Proposal #1:

    A website much like Galvanize Delivers, but butcher themed. This site would solve the issue of not being able to get meat, enough meat, and the right kinds of meat, which, I think we can all agree is a troubling and widespread issue.

    The target user is carnivorous, alive, hungry, lazy, with a sense of humor. I would also like to weave a survivalistic theme into the design. Survivalists are hip; I mean, the end is Nigh!!!

    I would be using html, css, likely Materialize, and vanilla Javascript. Functionality will include (hopefully), two pages linked via meat icon and navbar, an interactive butcher map of a pig which sends items(i.e. pork loins) to the shopping cart, animal noises on icon click, and client side validation in the shape of an order form.


Proposals #2:

    My secondary idea is to make a simple and silly quiz game like the Your Spirit Grilled Cheese site I found online. I don't quite yet know about the theme, though maybe conspiracy theories could factor in somehow in sticking with a survivalist vibe.

    It would solve the need to be entertained, to giggle.

    The target user is someone who is curious, perhaps bored, and likes to laugh.

    The technologies would be html, css, Materialize or grid, Javascript.
